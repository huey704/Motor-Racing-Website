<h1>Motor-Racing-Website</h1>
<h2>RaceSync</h2>

This Website will be able to track multiple motor racing series on a three column layout like having F1, WEC and NASCAR with the dates and times of the free practices, qualifying, and race date and time. 

The goal of this website is to, solve a problem that others and I deal with, finding the times and dates across difference racing series can be annoying with the official websites for these racing series having bad layouts and not intuitive to find. This project is also serves as a way to sharpen my html and css skills, while learning backend development. Eventually I plan to integrate an API with node js so the site can auto-update with the latest schedule data. If anyone views this please give any constructive critisim as learning from the experience of others is a great tool. Thank you

This is the basic layout of the website. It will have three columns that will include three different racing series with the included dates and times.

This is a more finalized and better looking website. The colors were chosen based on the racing series. Formula 1's main color is red, WEC's main color is blue, and Nascar has three colors red, blue and yellow. Since the other two series already use those colors, I chose yellow for the Nascar's color. The font, font size, background, columns, and the incluion of the scroll bar if the page is too long are the main additions. Included are mock information on how the final product would look like. The main thing that still need work on aesthetically is the background and the placement of the name. While deciding on the background I will start learning JavaScript and work towards node.js to work on the backend of my website.
