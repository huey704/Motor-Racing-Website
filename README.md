This Website will be able to track multiple motor racing series on a three column layout. Like have F1, WEC and NASCAR with the dates and times of the free practices, qualifying, and race date and time. The purpose of this website and project to refine my html and css skills with the incluion of learning backend development with an api to auto update the website with the revelent information. I am working on the frontend first with the html and css and will learn how to get the api to work with node.js. If anyone views this please give any constructive critisim as learning from the experience of others is a great tool. Thank you
