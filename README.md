<h1>Motor-Racing-Website</h1>
<h2>RaceSync</h2>
This Website will be able to track multiple motor racing series on a three column layout. Like have F1, WEC and NASCAR with the dates and times of the free practices, qualifying, and race date and time. The objective of this website and project are two things, solve a problem that other and I deal with, finding the times and dates of difference race series can be annoying with the website for these series can be bad and not intuitive to find, and to refine my html and css skills with the incluion of learning backend development with an api to auto update the website with the revelent information. I am working on the frontend first with the html and css as I have more experience with that and will learn how to get the api to work with node.js. If anyone views this please give any constructive critisim as learning from the experience of others is a great tool. Thank you
